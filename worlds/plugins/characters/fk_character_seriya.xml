            {70}She possesses a lithe and agile build, standing at a modest height with a
            physique that hints at both strength and grace. Her skin is a smooth, pale
            canvas accentuated by the angular elven features that hint at her mixed
            heritage. Delicately pointed ears and high cheekbones frame her face, which
            slants along the jawline to a narrow chin, giving her an air of sharpness
            and precision. Her eyes are a warm {30}ha{A0}z{B0}e{30}l{70}, flecked with hints of green and
            gold, bright and perceptive. A faint scar runs diagonally across her left
            cheek and might subtley draw the eye further to her lips. The latter are
            full and often settle into a thoughtful, neutral expression.
            {00}.
            {70}She wears her hair loosely gathered in a braid of chestnut brown, allowing
            a few strands free to frame her face. A small, intricate tattoo of a black
            {80}thorn vine {70}winds around her left wrist, and just above the right breast,
            usually hidden beneath the fabric of her clothing, is a delicate inkwork
            of a lovely flowery {10}bl{90}o{10}ss{90}o{10}m{70}.

            {80}This appears to be a woman of mixed blood - of drow and of human heritage. The
            former seems more pronounced at least in her physical appearance, which is
            dominated by the grace and sharp features of elvenkind held beneath the sleek
            midnight skin characteristic of their subterranean kin.
            {00}.
            {80}Her face, if ever it is seen fully exposed, is as sharp as a sword's edge,
                narrow and defined, sheathed amid {F0}thick braids {80}and a few {F0}loose strands {80}of
                stark white. A faint scar appears as a faintly lighter {70}li{80}ne on her left
                cheek and might draw the eye subtley toward her full, {50}painted {80}lips. Her
                human parentage is perhaps most noticeable in her eyes, which, though
                slanted with the common almond shape of an elf, are colored a warm {30}h{B0}a{30}z{A0}e{30}l
            {80}that nonetheless holds a hint of danger.
            {00}.
            {80}Her musculature is firm, undeniably honed, but not so pronounced that she would
            pass for a warrior at first sight. Instead, the woman's garb tends to accentuate
            moreso her feminine curves and easy grace held within an almost feline poise.
            The scent that most often accompanies her is a clean, almost neutral fragrance
            that predators might find some difficulty in following for long.
